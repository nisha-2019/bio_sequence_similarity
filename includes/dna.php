      <p class="">DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans   and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has   the same DNA. Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is   called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the   mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).</p>
        <p>The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical   bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human   DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those   bases are the same in all people. The order, or sequence, of these   bases determines the information available for building and maintaining   an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet appear   in a certain order to form words and sentences.</p>
        <p>DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form   units called base pairs. Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule   and a phosphate molecule. Together, a base, sugar, and phosphate are   called a nucleotide. Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that   form a spiral called a double helix. The structure of the double helix   is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladder’s   rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical   sidepieces of the ladder.</p>
        <p>An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies   of itself. Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a   pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when   cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the   DNA present in the old cell.</p>
