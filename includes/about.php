      <td align="justify"><p>Bioinformatics databases are libraries of life sciences information, collected from scientific experiments, published literature, high-throughput experiment technology, and computational analyses.They contain information from research areas including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microarray gene expression, and phylogenetics. Information contained in bioinformatics databases includes gene function, structure, localization (both cellular and chromosomal), clinical effects of mutations as well as similarities of biological sequences and structures.</p>
      <p>Bioinformmatics databases can be broadly classified into sequence and structure databases. Nucleic acid and protein sequences are stored in sequence databases and structure database only store proteins. These databases are important tools in assisting scientists to analyze and explain a host of biological phenomena from the structure of biomolecules and their interaction, to the whole metabolism of organisms and to understanding the evolution of species. This knowledge helps facilitate the fight against diseases, assists in the development of medications, predicting certain genetic diseases and in discovering basic relationships among species in the history of life.</p></td>
