      <td align="justify" ><p>Proteins are large molecules consisting of amino acids which our bodies and the cells in our bodies need to function properly. Our body structures, functions, the regulation of the body's cells, tissues and organs cannot exist without proteins.The human body's muscles, skin, bones and many other parts contain significant amounts of protein. In fact, protein accounts for 20% of total body weight.Enzymes, hormones and antibodies are proteins. Proteins also work as neurotransmitters and carriers of oxygen in the blood (hemoglobin).</p>
<p> protein is made up of amino acids; amino acids are the building blocks of protein, there are 20 of them. Imagine there are 20 different types of bricks, and a much larger number of different types of houses which we could name according to the way we combined the bricks (their sequence). The bricks are the amino acids and the houses are the proteins.</p></td>
