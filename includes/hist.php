      <td height="554" align="justify"><p>By 1981, 579 human genes had been mapped and mapping by in situ hybridization had become a standard method. Marvin Carruthers and Leory Hood made a huge leap in bioinformatics when they invented a method for automated DNA sequencing.  In 1988, the Human Genome organization (HUGO) was founded. This is an international organization of scientists involved in Human Genome Project. In 1989, the first complete genome map was published of the bacteria Haemophilus influenza .</p>
        <p>By 1991, a total of 1879 human genes had been mapped. In 1993, Genethon, a human genome research center in France Produced a physical map of the human genome. Three years later, Genethon published the final version of the Human Genetic Map. This concluded the end of the first phase of the Human Genome Project.        </p>
        <p>Bioinformatics was fuelled by the need to create huge databases, such as GenBank and EMBL and DNA Database of Japan to store and compare the DNA sequence data erupting from the human genome and other genome sequencing projects. <br />
        Today, bioinformatics embraces protein structure analysis, gene and protein functional information, data from patients, pre-clinical and clinical trials, and the metabolic pathways of numerous species.</p>

<p>Origin of bioinformatic/biological databses: </p>
<p><br />
  The first bioinformatic/biological databases were constructed a few years after the first protein sequences began to become available. The first protein sequence reported was that of bovine insulin in 1956 , consisting of 51 residues. Nearly a decade later, the first nucleic acid sequence was reported, that of yeast alanine tRNA with 77 bases. Just a year later, Dayhoff gathered all the availablesequence data to create the first bioinformatic database . <br />
  The Protein DataBank followed in 1972 with a collectionof ten X-ray crystallographic protein structures, and theSWISSPROT protein sequence database began in 1987. A huge variety of divergent data resources of different typesand sizes are now available either in the public domain or more recently from commercial third parties. All of the original databases were organised in a very simpleway with data entries being stored in flat files, either one perentry, or as a single large text file. Re-write - Later on lookup indexes were added to allow convenient keyword searching of header information.</p>
